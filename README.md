# So Pekocko

Welcome to my project So Pekocko !

This is the 6th project into my web developer training.
This project includes an API for a rating food app

## Getting Started

Clone this repository on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

For the server-side web applicactions, you need to install the Node.js runtime.
You can download it at the following link :
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To use the API you will need a front-end application. You can get it from Github :
* [Front-end](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/dwj-projet6)

### Installing

On your command line / shell, from the root folder types

```
npm install
node server
```

Then, from the root of the front-end folder, run the commands

```
npm install
npm start
```

Thanks to the last command, the front end will listen on the [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/)

## Deployment

Please be aware of the localhost port number used by your local machine when you deploy the front end application.
You can easily find it on your command line / shell.

## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The Javascript runtime used
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/fr/) - The framework used for the server
* [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) - Used as database as service
